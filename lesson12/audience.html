                    elementary school teacher.  They have two children ages 5 and 8.  They are interested in 
                    learning more about church history and exposing their children to different areas of the 
                    United states.  They plan on taking one temple trip a year.</blockquote>

                        both the United States and worldwide.  They are interested in visiting all of the 
                    temples in the areas described in their family histories and completing ordinance work there.
                They are looking for extended stays at each location and moving directly from one temple site to 
            another.</blockquote>
