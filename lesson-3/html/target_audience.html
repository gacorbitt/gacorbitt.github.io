                    <h3>Robert</h3>
                    Robert is a 55 year old small business owner from Arizona.  He is self employed so he can 
                    pursue his passion for outdoor sports.  He comes to Idaho every year because is has the 
                    best bear hunting outside of Alaska.  He knows that being from Arizona he isn't used to the 
                    cold so he has to know exactly what to expect when he goes to Idaho.
